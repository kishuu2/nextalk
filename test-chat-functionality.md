## Expected Behavior

### Chat List
- Shows all accepted friends/followers
- Displays last message preview (or "No messages yet")
- Highlights currently selected chat
- Updates last message when new message is sent

### Chat Window
- Shows chat history from localStorage
- Displays "No messages yet" if no previous chat
- Auto-scrolls to bottom on new messages
- Sends messages with proper timestamp

### URL Management
- Updates URL when chat is selected
- Supports direct access via URL
- Uses shallow routing (no page reload)

### Local Storage
- Stores messages with unique keys per chat pair
- Persists across browser sessions
- Updates last message cache for chat list

## Troubleshooting

### If messages don't persist:
- Check browser localStorage is enabled
- Verify localStorage keys are being created correctly
- Check for JavaScript errors in console

### If URL doesn't update:
- Verify Next.js router is working
- Check for router.push errors in console

### If theme doesn't apply:
- Verify ThemeContext is providing correct theme
- Check CSS module imports
- Verify theme styles are being applied

### If chat doesn't open:
- Check if user data is loading correctly
- Verify handleChatSelect function is called
- Check selectedChat state updates

## Browser Compatibility
- Chrome/Edge: Full support
- Firefox: Full support
- Safari: Full support
- Mobile browsers: Responsive design supported

## Performance Notes

- Large chat histories may need cleanup mechanism
- Consider implementing message limit per chat for performance
